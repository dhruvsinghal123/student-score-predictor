# 🎓 Student Score Predictor
This project uses a **Linear Regression** machine learning model to predict a student's exam score based on the number of hours they studied.
> 📘 Built using Python, Jupyter Notebook, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Scikit-learn.
---
## 📂 Project Files

- `student_score_predictor.ipynb` — Main Jupyter Notebook with training, testing, evaluation
- `student_scores.csv` — Dataset with hours studied and scores
---
## 📊 Problem Statement

**Can we predict how much a student will score based on hours studied?**
We used a simple dataset containing:
- **Hours** studied
- **Scores** obtained
---
## 🧠 Technologies Used
- Python 3
- Jupyter Notebook
- NumPy & Pandas
- Matplotlib & Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
---

## 🚀 Results

- Model: **Linear Regression**
- Evaluation: **Mean Squared Error = 12.78**
- Accuracy: Predicted scores were very close to actual ones
---

## 💡 Future Work

- Convert to a web app using **Streamlit**
- Improve accuracy with more data or polynomial regression

---

## 📌 How to Use

1. Open `student_score_predictor.ipynb`
2. Run all cells (ensure dependencies are installed)
3. Change the `hours` value at the end to get predictions!
